# GSM-Based-security-door-alarm-system-using-microcontroller

**INTRODUCTION**

We have designed a gsm based security alarm system using Arduino. By this project offers an affordable and reliable security solution that is easy to set up. The system can send real time alerts, such as calls or notifications, if someone tries to break in. By using Arduino and GSM technology, our system enhances safety in homes and commercials, addressing the cost and accessibility issues of traditional security systems.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**

In todays world the need for enhanced security measures in residential and commercial
buildings is growing significantly. Traditional security systems often pose challenges due to
their high costs and complex installation processes. Additional many existing systems fail to
provide real time alerting capabilities, which are crucial for timely response to security reaches.
To address these issues, this project aims to develop a cost effective, easy to implement security
alarm system that leverages Arduino and GSM technology. This system will offer real time
intrusion detection and alerting thereby enhancing the safety and security of both residential
and commercial spaces.

**SOLUTION**

• Our proposed solution is to GSM based security alarm system using Arduino.

• This system will detect intrusions using sensors connected t the Arduino which will
then send real time alerts via SMS or call to predefined phone numbers using the GSM
module.

• It will be cost effective, easy to install and provide timely alerts to enhance security in
both residential and commercial settings.
